00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Linux Terminal Setup

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,867
On Google play  store and download

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,640
Termux Application

4
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:17,033
Install the application

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,233
Termux is a Linux environment application

6
00:00:25,157 --> 00:00:29,157
Every Linux command can be run and

7
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:33,181
executed on the termux application.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,200
After installation, start the application

9
00:00:36,224 --> 00:00:38,224
to see this black environment

10
00:00:38,233 --> 00:00:40,733
(N.B: The keyboard used is known as

11
00:00:40,757 --> 00:00:43,257
hackers keyboard which can be found

12
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:45,481
on google play store.)

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,600
Update termux using 'pkg update'

14
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:52,624
'pkg' stands for package

15
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:55,648
This updates the application to

16
00:00:55,672 --> 00:00:58,672
the latest version

17
00:00:58,696 --> 00:01:01,696
Whenever a package is installing

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,720
or updating, the terminal asks for

19
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,744
permission to continue; remember to always

20
00:01:05,768 --> 00:01:10,768
select a yes by typing 'y'

21
00:01:10,792 --> 00:01:13,792
This will allow the application package to

22
00:01:13,816 --> 00:01:16,816
install or update completely

23
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,840
Some packages take time to install,

24
00:01:19,864 --> 00:01:22,864
while others are faster

25
00:01:22,888 --> 00:01:27,888
Try to wait patiently for the packages

26
00:01:27,912 --> 00:01:32,912
to be fully installed or updated.

27
00:01:57,133 --> 00:01:59,133
Go to www.google.com in your browser

28
00:01:59,157 --> 00:02:01,157
search for 'oh-my-termux'

29
00:02:01,181 --> 00:02:03,181
and go to this github repository

30
00:02:03,205 --> 00:02:05,205

00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:18,933
Go back to your termux terminal

34
00:02:18,957 --> 00:02:22,957

35
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:25,981

36
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:30,005
Return to your browser,

37
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:36,929
highlight and copy the URL

38
00:02:36,953 --> 00:02:40,553
under Installation

39
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:46,767
Go back to the your termux terminal

40
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,791

41
00:02:49,815 --> 00:02:53,815
and press 'enter'

42
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:14,200
After the cloning is completed,

43
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:20,724
allow termux to access you android device

44
00:03:21,048 --> 00:03:25,548
You will need to restart your android

45
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:29,172
device to complete your installations

46
00:03:29,196 --> 00:03:37,196
Type 'exit' to quit the application

47
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:41,733
Restart your termux application

48
00:03:41,757 --> 00:03:47,357
Notice the new background of your terminal

49
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,967
Install new packages using the command

50
00:03:50,991 --> 00:03:55,991
'pkg install'

51
00:03:56,015 --> 00:04:01,015
First two packages you will install are

52
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:09,039
'unzip' and 'git'

53
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,700
The first git command used in this tutorial

54
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:16,724
is 'git config' used with these flags

55
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:20,824
'--global username' and '--global email'

56
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:24,847
This command is used to add your

57
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:28,848
github username and password to your

58
00:04:28,872 --> 00:04:33,872
local git repository on your android device

59
00:04:46,796 --> 00:04:51,796
(You will learn of git and github in

60
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,820
later tutorial videos)

61
00:05:32,944 --> 00:05:40,944
N.B: You will need to create a

62
00:05:40,968 --> 00:05:48,968
github account in order to set your

63
00:05:48,992 --> 00:05:56,992
username and email

64
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,267
To check the version of git you have,

65
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:13,291
the flag '--version'

66
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:30,533
