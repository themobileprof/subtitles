Adding a dot before a directory makes

93
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:52,229
it to become a hidden directory

94
00:09:55,143 --> 00:09:58,710
Check your file manager to see

95
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:02,534
the hidden directory created

96
00:10:03,214 --> 00:10:06,914

rm cannot delete a directory but

113
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:23,967
will result in an error

114
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:37,138
Instead a recursive flag is used after 'rm'

115
00:14:40,562 --> 00:14:44,562
rm -R 'path to directory'

116
00:14:45,214 --> 00:14:48,294
Check your file manager to confirm

117
00:14:49,318 --> 00:14:53,918
that the folders are successfully deleted

118
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:08,042
