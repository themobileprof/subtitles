00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,020
Neovim- Part 1

2
00:00:03,044 --> 00:00:05,044
In this tuturial, we will learn how to use

3
00:00:05,068 --> 00:00:07,068
the text editor, neovim

4
00:00:07,092 --> 00:00:10,092
Firstly, you will have to update your

5
00:00:10,116 --> 00:00:13,116
application

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,140
After updating, you will install the

7
00:00:16,164 --> 00:00:19,164
text editor

8
00:00:20,027 --> 00:00:28,027
pkg install neovim nodejs yarn

9
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:31,051
To install multiple packages(applications),

10
00:00:31,075 --> 00:00:34,075
you can type them all after 'pkg install'

11
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:37,599
'nodejs' is a package that will be

12
00:00:37,623 --> 00:00:41,123
needed when writing javascript codes

13
00:00:41,147 --> 00:00:48,147
'yarn' is a package manager for your code

14
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:52,071
All these packages will be installed

15
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:55,095
all at once.

16
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:59,619
Next, we will create a directory

17
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:03,643
named 'nvim' in a .config directory

18
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:08,667
Recall that 'mkdir' is the command

19
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:13,691
for creating new directories and the flag

20
00:01:13,715 --> 00:01:18,715
-p is for creating a parent directory

21
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:22,039
This means that /.config/ is the parent

22
00:01:22,063 --> 00:01:25,063
directory, while /nvim/ is the

23
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:28,087
sub directory.

24
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:31,411
We will do a 'git clone' command next

25
00:01:31,435 --> 00:01:34,435
which will clone all the contents of the

26
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:37,459
repository into our android device

27
00:01:37,483 --> 00:01:40,483
We are cloning the 'env.git' file,

28
00:01:40,507 --> 00:01:43,507
which means the file will be copied

29
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:46,531
from themobileprof's repository to

30
00:01:46,555 --> 00:01:49,355
our file manager on our android device

31
00:01:49,364 --> 00:01:57,297
Then copy the contents of the cloned file

32
00:01:57,321 --> 00:02:05,321
to the nvim directory you created earlier

33
00:02:06,045 --> 00:02:11,045
Be careful to replicate the exact commands

34
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:16,069
on the screen and take note of

35
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:21,093
the spacing between the directory you're

36
00:02:21,117 --> 00:02:26,117
copying from and to the one you're

37
00:02:26,141 --> 00:02:31,141
copying to

38
00:02:32,636 --> 00:02:35,636
Next, go to your browser and search for

39
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,660
'vim-plug' on google.

40
00:02:38,684 --> 00:02:43,684
Go to the github repository as seen

41
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:48,708
on this video.

42
00:02:49,132 --> 00:02:54,432
Scroll down to neovim and under unix/linux

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,080
Highlight and copy the

44
00:03:05,104 --> 00:03:11,104
URL as seen

45
00:03:11,528 --> 00:03:17,528
Be careful to highlight every word and

46
00:03:17,552 --> 00:03:23,552
every letter

47
00:03:31,636 --> 00:03:36,703
Paste the URL in your termux terminal

48
00:03:36,827 --> 00:03:40,827
After the successful installation,

49
00:03:40,851 --> 00:03:44,251
you can open the neovim text editor

50
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:47,775
with the command 'nvim'

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This is the neovim environment

52
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,024
Install the basic neovim plugin using the

53
00:03:56,048 --> 00:04:04,048
:PlugInstall command

54
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:08,472
N.B: In Neovim, the colon mark preceeds

55
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:12,496
every command.

56
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,520
After the installation is completed,

57
00:04:17,544 --> 00:04:22,044
you'll have to quit the installation page

58
00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:28,844
The command, ":q" is used to quit

59
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:33,794
You can now edit on your neovim and quit

60
00:04:33,818 --> 00:04:37,818
but the command to quit after editing,

61
00:04:37,842 --> 00:04:41,842
without saving, is different from ":q"

62
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:46,866
The command to force quit is ":q!"

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Go back to neovim editor to continue

64
00:04:52,024 --> 00:04:56,024
more plugin installations

65
00:04:56,848 --> 00:05:00,148
The next plugin to be installed is known as

66
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:03,572
CoC(Conquer of Completion). It is a

67
00:05:03,582 --> 00:05:06,582
plugin that makes your neovim to be as

68
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,606
a code editor on a computer.

69
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:17,630
The command to install is ":CocInstall"

70
00:05:17,654 --> 00:05:22,654
followed by other necessary extensions

71
00:05:23,078 --> 00:05:31,078
such as coc-html, coc-css

72
00:05:31,502 --> 00:05:39,401
coc-emmet, coc-git, coc-json

73
00:05:40,825 --> 00:05:48,825
coc-emmet, coc-git, coc-json

74
00:05:57,049 --> 00:06:05,049
coc-phpls, coc-tsserver

75
00:06:05,173 --> 00:06:13,173
coc-phpls, coc-tsserver

76
00:06:13,302 --> 00:06:18,602
 coc-phpls, coc-tsserver

77
00:06:18,818 --> 00:06:23,852
It will a little time for all these

78
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:28,876
 installations to be completed.

79
00:06:29,545 --> 00:06:32,579
This plugin is useful for fast instant

80
00:06:32,603 --> 00:06:35,603
increment code completion;

81
00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:39,227
It is also reliable, features full LSP

82
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:42,251
(Language Server Protocol) support.

83
00:06:42,275 --> 00:06:46,275
It makes neovim to be configured like

84
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:50,299
VSCode and the extensions will work

85
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:54,323
just like in VSCode.

86
00:06:55,047 --> 00:07:01,047
Quit neovim and restart

87
00:07:01,727 --> 00:07:04,894
To start editing a new file with neovim,

88
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:08,018
type the name of the file after 'nvim'

89
00:07:09,142 --> 00:07:17,142
That is:  nvim 'NameofFile'

90
00:07:19,636 --> 00:07:22,636
You will discover that you are unable to

91
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,660
edit or type anything. This is because you

92
00:07:25,684 --> 00:07:28,684
are not yet in INSERT MODE.

93
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,708
Currently this is the NORMAL MODE where

94
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:34,732
you will unable to edit you can only

95
00:07:34,756 --> 00:07:37,756
copy and paste here

96
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,780
To switch from one mode to another

97
00:07:41,804 --> 00:07:45,804
press the ESC key on your hackers keyboard

98
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,500
To enter into INSERT MODE, just type

99
00:08:00,524 --> 00:08:03,524
the letter "i"

100
00:08:05,455 --> 00:08:08,621
Now you can be able to type into

101
00:08:08,645 --> 00:08:11,645
the editor

102
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:24,236
You can use your arrow keys to navigate

103
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,360
between words and letters

104
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:30,384
within your editor

105
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:34,508
Use the ESC key to exit the insert mode

106
00:08:34,532 --> 00:08:36,532
An alternative to the arrow keys are the

107
00:08:36,556 --> 00:08:38,556
letters "k", "j", "h" and "l"

108
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:46,380
"k" is for scrolling upwards,

109
00:08:47,182 --> 00:08:51,182
"j" is for downward scrolling

110
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:54,182
"h" is for moving to the left

111
00:08:54,364 --> 00:08:56,364
"l" is for moving to the right

112
00:08:56,588 --> 00:09:00,588
(Note that all these navigation can only

113
00:09:00,612 --> 00:09:04,612
be done when in normal mode.)

114
00:09:13,218 --> 00:09:18,218
Apart from using the  letter "i" to enter

115
00:09:18,242 --> 00:09:23,242
insert mode, letter "a" can also be used

116
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:28,266
But notice that "i" places the cursor

117
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,290
behind the character,

118
00:09:33,314 --> 00:09:38,314
while "a" places the cursor in front

119
00:09:38,338 --> 00:09:42,338
of the character.

120
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:50,364
Capital letter "A" puts the cursor at the

121
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:58,388
beginning of the line, while

122
00:09:58,412 --> 00:10:06,412
capital letter "I" places the cursor at

123
00:10:06,436 --> 00:10:14,436
the end of the line.

124
00:10:22,182 --> 00:10:26,182
To jump between words, that is,

125
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:30,506
from word to word towards the right,

126
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:35,030
for easier and faster navigation,

127
00:10:35,627 --> 00:10:43,627
the letter "w" is used

128
00:10:43,964 --> 00:10:46,964
while the letter "b" is used to jump

129
00:10:46,988 --> 00:10:50,588
backwards, from right to left.

130
00:10:50,727 --> 00:10:53,727
The use of letter "e" is similar to that of

131
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:57,751
"w", but "e" jumps to the end of a word

132
00:10:57,775 --> 00:11:01,775
while "w" jumps to the beginning of a word

133
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:03,899
To jump to another line, you can

134
00:11:03,923 --> 00:11:06,323
type the line number using this command

135
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:11,364
: + line number

136
00:11:11,388 --> 00:11:16,388
[Try to practice these commands

137
00:11:16,412 --> 00:11:21,412
in different possible ways]

138
00:11:21,413 --> 00:11:23,041
To jump backwards to the beginning of a

139
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:25,066
line from your current cursor position,

140
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:27,491
the number "0" is used

141
00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:30,991
while the character "$" is used to jump

142
00:11:31,015 --> 00:11:32,635
the end of the line.

143
00:11:32,636 --> 00:11:34,696
Capital letter "G" is used to jump to the

144
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
end of your document,

145
00:11:36,855 --> 00:11:38,755
while letter "g" is used to jump to the

146
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:40,779
beginning of the document.

147
00:11:41,003 --> 00:11:46,003
Remember all these commands apply

148
00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:51,027
only in NORMAL MODE.

149
00:12:13,586 --> 00:12:18,586
To delete just a single character or

150
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:23,611
a letter in a line,

151
00:12:23,636 --> 00:12:31,636
the letter "x" is used

152
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,660
the letter "x" is used

153
00:12:49,386 --> 00:12:51,386
To use the quit command, be sure you are

154
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:53,486
in the normal mode. Press the ESC key if

155
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:55,511
you are not sure

156
00:12:55,636 --> 00:13:00,636
If you try to quit without saving your

157
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:08,660
changes,  you will see an error message

158
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,400
The command to save is ":w"

159
00:13:24,401 --> 00:13:32,323
The command to save is ":w"

160
00:13:32,324 --> 00:13:35,324
which means to write in

161
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:38,648
your internal storage

162
00:13:38,672 --> 00:13:41,972
You can now successfully quit after saving

163
00:13:42,545 --> 00:13:44,679
Use your UP arrow key to display your

164
00:13:44,703 --> 00:13:46,703
previous command and press ENTER

165
00:13:47,455 --> 00:13:49,721
We will make some changes to this

166
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,745
file and then try to force quit

167
00:13:59,764 --> 00:14:04,764
Type  "a" to enter into insert mode

168
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:13,888
[You can probably choose to type

169
00:14:13,912 --> 00:14:21,912
whatever you prefer]

170
00:14:32,545 --> 00:14:37,545
Make sure to exit normal mode before

171
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:39,569
typing the quit command

172
00:14:39,593 --> 00:14:41,593
The error is because we did not

173
00:14:41,617 --> 00:14:43,090
save changes before trying to quit.

174
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,024
Now try the fore quit command which is

175
00:14:46,048 --> 00:14:54,048
:q!

176
00:14:56,818 --> 00:14:58,752
Display the previous command

177
00:14:58,776 --> 00:15:00,776
using your up arrow and press enter

178
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:05,875
You will discover that all the

179
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,900
 previous changes made were gone

180
00:15:10,924 --> 00:15:16,924
because we did not save and

181
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:23,048
we forcefully quit.

182
00:15:28,972 --> 00:15:36,972
Now still make new changes to the document

183
00:15:36,996 --> 00:15:44,996
Now still make new changes to the document

184
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,045
Save changes and quit using the command

185
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:51,769
:wq

186
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,980
This ends this tutorial
