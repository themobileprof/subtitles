then create a sub-directory inside 'sites'

4
00:00:10,152 --> 00:00:15,152
and name it 'sample1'.

5
00:00:15,195 --> 00:00:20,195
Change directory from home [~] to

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:28,160
'sites/sample1' directory

00:00:30,608 --> 00:00:38,608
Open a new file in neovim named 'file.txt'

or lines that you want to copy or cut

20
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:38,939
This is the same with 'click and drag'

21
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:42,963
on PCs or on other applications

22
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:50,813

Capital letter "V" is used  to select

29
00:02:08,856 --> 00:02:10,856
line after line, not words.

30
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,770

39
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:51,354
press letter "p" to paste.

40
00:02:52,078 --> 00:02:57,078
Remember you are still in

41
00:02:57,102 --> 00:03:02,102
normal mode.

42
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:06,126
There is another letter used to

43
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,150

In neovim, the command to copy

50
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:58,001
is known as yanking.

51
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:01,125
Scroll to a line and place your cursor on a

52
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:04,325

Practice by pasting in differnt places

58
00:05:22,945 --> 00:05:25,945
You can create a new file from your

59
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,970
current file.

60
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:36,995
Using the command :!touch 'nameofFile'

61
00:05:59,131 --> 00:06:03,131
You can also create a new directory from

62
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:07,156
your current file, using this command

63
00:06:07,381 --> 00:06:15,381
:!mkdir 'NameOfDirectory

64
00:06:15,405 --> 00:06:23,405
:!mkdir 'NameOfDirectory

65
00:07:07,576 --> 00:07:12,576
To view your files and directories

66
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:17,601

Use capital letter "R" to refresh

74
00:08:19,164 --> 00:08:21,664

75
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:24,817

86
00:10:07,276 --> 00:10:12,276

Press ctrl+O to close the NerdTree

90
00:10:28,672 --> 00:10:36,672

91
00:10:36,996 --> 00:10:39,496
type "html:5" followed by 2 commas(,,)

92
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,120
In Emmet, double commas are used to

93
00:10:42,144 --> 00:10:44,144
execute or complete tags in html.

94
00:10:44,168 --> 00:10:46,168
So the complete HTML boiler-plate is

95
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:48,192
written out for you to make things easier.

96
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:02,645

type "div>div" followed by double commas

99
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,850
To create a heading tag,

100
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,875
type "h1" followed by double commas

101
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:25,899
Type your heading in between the opening

102
00:12:25,923 --> 00:12:27,923

Go to a new line and type "p" followed by

104
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:31,971
2 commas. You now have a paragraph tag

105
00:12:31,995 --> 00:12:33,995
Edit your paragraph between the tags

106
00:12:53,030 --> 00:13:00,030
Emmet allows you to type shrinked commands

107
00:13:00,055 --> 00:13:07,055
 and then the double comma's expand those

108
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 commands into full parent and child tags.

109
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:28,050
The dot represents a div with a class while

110
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:50,790
the # represents a div with an id

111
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The > sign is to create a child tag while

112
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
the + sign is to create a sibling tag and

113
00:15:09,001 --> 00:15:16,001
the ^ symbol is to create a parent-sibling

114
00:15:16,025 --> 00:15:19,025
tag.

115
00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:26,061
Remember to use double commas to execute

116
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,660
You can see the expanded code now

117
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:50,173
Type in anything within your div tags

118
00:15:52,157 --> 00:15:55,837
ESC and save your page and quit using this

119
00:15:55,861 --> 00:16:01,861
command :wq

120
00:16:03,225 --> 00:16:05,025
Do an 'ls' to list out the contents of your

121
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:06,349
PWD (present working directory)

122
00:16:06,373 --> 00:16:09,673
Copy your html file to ~/storage/shared/

123
00:16:11,128 --> 00:16:13,628
Go to your file manager and look for

124
00:16:13,652 --> 00:16:15,652
 the html file you just created and copied.

125
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:19,876
When you have found it, open it

126
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,600
It will open up in a browser and

127
00:16:23,624 --> 00:16:27,924
display all you wrote in your html file.

128
00:16:31,428 --> 00:16:39,428
Go back to your termux terminal and exit.
